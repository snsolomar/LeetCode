//Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

//in programming, recursion occurs when a function calls itselfs

//any iterator function (aka function with a loop) can be a recursive instead
//an example of this is provided in practice2.js
//practice.js was a scratch board for my learning material related to recursion
