//Stacks
//imagine you have a stack of books. You start with one book. You put another book on top of it.
//in order to get to the first book, you must first remove the book you put on top of it
//this is called LIFO, last in first out
//pushing is to put something to the end of the stack
//popping is removing something from the end of the stack

//Queue
//imagine you have a line at the bank. You want to go see the teller.
//There is no one in line so you go first. you are now at the front of the line.
//more people enter after you. They enter the line, but fall behind you in the order in which they arrived.
//once the teller is ready, you can leave and the person behind you moves up.
//this is called FIFO, first in first out
//enqueue is to put something at the end of the line
//dequeue is to take something at the front of the Line
